# RateDependentEcosystemExpts
R scripts for simulation models to study rate-dependence in whole-ecosystem experiments

The data and code were used for simulations, analyses of resilience indicators, and plots for the manuscript
"Ecosystem Experiments:  How Does Manipulation Rate Affect Responses and Dynamic Indicators of Resilience?"

The included PDF file has a table to state which script(s) were used to create each figure or conduct each analysis.
